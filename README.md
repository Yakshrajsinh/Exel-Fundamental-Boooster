## Essential Tasks

### 1. Relative & Absolute References, Formatting, and Data Input
- Enter and format data (bold, italic, currency, date, and custom formats).  
- Use **absolute ($A$1)** and **relative (A1)** references in formulas.

### 2. IF Formulas & Nested IFs
- Classify students' grades based on scores.  
- Compute discounts for sales based on price thresholds.

### 3. IF with AND/OR Formulas
- Identify students scoring above 80 in both Math & Science using `IF(AND(...))`.  
- Determine product discount eligibility using `IF(OR(...))`.

### 4. COUNTIFS, SUMIFS, AVERAGEIFS
- Count students scoring above 50 in Math.  
- Sum total sales for a specific region and product.  
- Calculate the average score for students above 60.

### 5. VLOOKUP
- Fetch student names based on ID from a separate dataset.  
- Retrieve product prices using product codes.

### 6. INDEX & MATCH
- Find sales values for a specific salesperson in a given month.  
- Lookup employee details dynamically without column restrictions.

### 7. TEXT Functions
- Extract first names using `LEFT()` and `FIND()`.  
- Convert names to uppercase/lowercase using `UPPER()`/`LOWER()`.

### 8. XLOOKUP & XMATCH
- Search salesperson performance based on flexible criteria.  
- Find employee salaries without requiring sorted data.  
- Find the position of a product in a sales list using `XMATCH`.

### 9. INDIRECT & OFFSET
- Dynamically reference ranges using `INDIRECT`.  
- Create dynamic ranges for sales trends using `OFFSET`.

### 10. Date & Time Functions
- Calculate age from date of birth.  
- Find differences in days between two dates.

### 11. Math Functions
- Use `ROUND()`, `CEILING()`, and `FLOOR()` for financial calculations.

### 12. FILTER Function
- Extract a list of top-performing students based on scores.
